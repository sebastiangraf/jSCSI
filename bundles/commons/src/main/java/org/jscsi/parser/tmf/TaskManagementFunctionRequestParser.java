     * For all these functions, the Task Management function response MUST be returned as detailed in Section 10.6 Task
     * Management Function Response. All these functions apply to the referenced tasks regardless of whether they are
     * proper SCSI tasks or tagged iSCSI operations. Task management requests must act on all the commands from the same
     * session having a CmdSN lower than the task management CmdSN. LOGICAL UNIT RESET, TARGET WARM RESET and TARGET
     * COLD RESET may affect commands from other sessions or commands from the same session with CmdSN equal or
     * exceeding CmdSN.
     * <p>
     * If the task management request is marked for immediate delivery, it must be considered immediately for execution,
     * but the operations involved (all or part of them) may be postponed to allow the target to receive all relevant
     * tasks. According to [SAM2], for all the tasks covered by the Task Management response (i.e., with CmdSN lower
     * than the task management command CmdSN) but except the Task Management response to a TASK REASSIGN, additional
     * responses MUST NOT be delivered to the SCSI layer after the Task Management response. The iSCSI initiator MAY
     * deliver to the SCSI layer all responses received before the Task Management response (i.e., it is a matter of
     * implementation if the SCSI responses, received before the Task Management response but after the task management
     * request was issued, are delivered to the SCSI layer by the iSCSI layer in the initiator). The iSCSI target MUST
     * ensure that no responses for the tasks covered by a task management function are delivered to the iSCSI initiator
     * after the Task Management response except for a task covered by a TASK REASSIGN.
     * <p>
     * For ABORT TASK SET and CLEAR TASK SET, the issuing initiator MUST continue to respond to all valid target
     * transfer tags (received via R2T, Text Response, NOP-In, or SCSI Data-In PDUs) related to the affected task set,
     * even after issuing the task management request. The issuing initiator SHOULD however terminate (i.e., by setting
     * the F-bit to 1) these response sequences as quickly as possible. The target on its part MUST wait for responses
     * on all affected target transfer tags before acting on either of these two task management requests. In case all
     * or part of the response sequence is not received (due to digest errors) for a valid TTT, the target MAY treat it
     * as a case of within-command error recovery class (see Section 6.1.4.1 Recovery Within-command) if it is
     * supporting ErrorRecoveryLevel >= 1, or alternatively may drop the connection to complete the requested task set
     * function.
     * <p>
     * If an ABORT TASK is issued for a task created by an immediate command then RefCmdSN MUST be that of the Task
     * Management request itself (i.e., CmdSN and RefCmdSN are equal); otherwise RefCmdSN MUST be set to the CmdSN of
     * the task to be aborted (lower than CmdSN).
     * <p>
     * If the connection is still active (it is not undergoing an implicit or explicit logout), ABORT TASK MUST be
     * issued on the same connection to which the task to be aborted is allegiant at the time the Task Management
     * Request is issued. If the connection is implicitly or explicitly logged out (i.e., no other request will be
     * issued on the failing connection and no other response will be received on the failing connection), then an ABORT
     * TASK function request may be issued on another connection. This Task Management request will then establish a new
     * allegiance for the command to be aborted as well as abort it (i.e., the task to be aborted will not have to be
     * retried or reassigned, and its status, if issued but not acknowledged, will be reissued followed by the Task
     * Management response).
     * <p>
     * At the target an ABORT TASK function MUST NOT be executed on a Task Management request; such a request MUST
     * result in Task Management response of "Function rejected".
     * <p>
     * For the LOGICAL UNIT RESET function, the target MUST behave as dictated by the Logical Unit Reset function in
     * [SAM2].
     * <p>
     * The implementation of the TARGET WARM RESET function and the TARGET COLD RESET function is OPTIONAL and when
     * implemented, should act as described below. The TARGET WARM RESET is also subject to SCSI access controls on the
     * requesting initiator as defined in [SPC3]. When authorization fails at the target, the appropriate response as
     * described in Section 10.6 Task Management Function Response MUST be returned by the target. The TARGET COLD RESET
     * function is not subject to SCSI access controls, but its execution privileges may be managed by iSCSI mechanisms
     * such as login authentication.
     * <p>
     * When executing the TARGET WARM RESET and TARGET COLD RESET functions, the target cancels all pending operations
     * on all Logical Units known by the issuing initiator. Both functions are equivalent to the Target Reset function
     * specified by [SAM2]. They can affect many other initiators logged in with the servicing SCSI target port.
     * <p>
     * The target MUST treat the TARGET COLD RESET function additionally as a power on event, thus terminating all of
     * its TCP connections to all initiators (all sessions are terminated). For this reason, the Service Response
     * (defined by [SAM2]) for this SCSI task management function may not be reliably delivered to the issuing initiator
     * port. For the TASK REASSIGN function, the target should reassign the connection allegiance to this new connection
     * (and thus resume iSCSI exchanges for the task). TASK REASSIGN MUST ONLY be received by the target after the
     * connection on which the command was previously executing has been successfully logged-out. The Task Management
     * response MUST be issued before the reassignment becomes effective. For additional usage semantics see Section 6.2
     * Retry and Reassign in Recovery.
     * <p>
     * At the target a TASK REASSIGN function request MUST NOT be executed to reassign the connection allegiance of a
     * Task Management function request, an active text negotiation task, or a Logout task; such a request MUST result
     * in Task Management response of "Function rejected".
     * <p>
     * TASK REASSIGN MUST be issued as an immediate command.
